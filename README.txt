Publishes your article to the steem blockchain automatically to allow you to earn money.

== Description ==
SteemPress is a wordpress plugin to allow you to automatically publish your articles on the steem blockchain when you publish them on your blog.

Steem is a blockchain on which you can post content which gets rewarded with steem tokens depending on the upvotes you received.

So, what if you as a blog owner could automatically share your posts to the steem blockchain directly from wordpress to get all the added benefits that the blockchain has to offer?
It would help you gain a new audience and by having your followers come to steem to upvote your posts it could also guarantee a second source of income.

You can follow the value of a steem token here : https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/
