Publishes your article to the steem blockchain automatically to allow you to earn money.

== Description ==
SteemPress is a wordpress plugin to allow you to automatically publish your articles on the STEEM blockchain whenever you publish them on your blog.

STEEM is a blockchain where content and contributions are rewarded with STEEM tokens depending on the upvotes from other users. The crypto currency STEEM can be traded with anyone online and has 0 transactions costs and 3 seconds transactions times.

So, what benefits could you as a blog owner get by also sharing your posts on the STEEM blockchain?

- It may also provide a new source of income, as content posted on STEEM earns its own rewards based on upvotes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Like most other apps on STEEM, including esteem, dtube, dsound, dmania, utopian and zappl to name a few, we intend to use benefactor rewards to help run SteemPress. The benefactor rewards is currently set to 10%. In comparison, Dtube and Utopian both take 25% benefactor rewards while Zappl takes 15%.

We (fredrikaa and howo) are determined to do our best to keep this percentage low in order to incentivise more use. Discussions on the use of benefactor rewards, and what rates they should be, are of course welcomed.to do our best to keep this percentage low in order to incentivise more use.
